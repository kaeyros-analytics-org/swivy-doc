Real-Time Location Tracking
==============================
Swivy provides a real-time map view of all Sales Reps' locations. Reporting Managers can see where each Sales Rep is currently located and their task status.

Task Management
==================
Sales Reps can update their tasks in the app, allowing Reporting Managers to monitor progress throughout the day. Tasks can be marked as pending, in-progress, or completed.

Notifications and Alerts
===========================
Swivy allows Reporting Managers to send notifications to Sales Reps. These notifications can be used to alert Sales Reps of errors, suspected misconduct, or any urgent instructions. Sales Reps can also send alerts to their Reporting Managers if they encounter any issues.

Issue Reporting
======================
Sales Reps can report any issues they face directly through the Swivy app. These reports are sent to the respective Reporting Managers for prompt action.
