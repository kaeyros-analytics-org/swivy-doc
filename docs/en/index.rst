Swivy is an application designed to monitor sales agents' movements and tasks across various points of sale. A sales agent's workday involves traveling from one point of sale to another to perform different tasks. With Swivy, you can track a sales agent's location on a map in real-time, allowing you to see their current position and task status. Each sales agent is linked to a reporting manager who monitors their locations and sends notifications in case of errors or suspected misconduct. Conversely, sales agents can alert their reporting managers if they encounter any issues. Companies can use Swivy by creating an account on the application and registering their reporting managers and sales agents. In the Swivy application, sales agents are referred to as Sales Reps, and administrators are known as Reporting Managers.
